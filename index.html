                    <img src="images/blockchain.jpeg" alt="blockchain"class="img_1">
                    <p class="message_1">Of course, campus events are one of the things that make university education interesting and memorable. In the last 3 years,
                         I have hosted and co-organized several events on campus. I often come across several students who are eager to host some kind of events too.
                         Where to start or how to start, seems an herculean task to them. So I decided to write few steps that will guide and help anyone pull off a successful event.Enjoy reading!

                            <h6>1. Decide what exactly you want to do</h6>
                            <img src="images/decide.jpeg" alt="decide">
                            <p>No doubt, you have to decide the kind and purpose of event you want to host on campus. Is it a tech meetup, a party, or a business seminar? 
                                You would then be able to carefully plan.</p>
                            <h6>2. Have a team</h6>
                            <img src="images/team.jpeg" alt="team">
                            <p>The saying goes thus, ‘a tree does not make a forest’. Working with dedicated people eases stress and helps. It’s better when you think of how to do a thing with
                                 someone who believes in the goal. You may have to run errands that are demanding physically and financially. You may be to do publicity and alot of other stuff that might weigh you down, especially if you are a student.
        
                                    But then, you have to select team members based on your needs. Every person has to specifically handle a responsibility. A team could be two people or more. Make sure everyone comes to fill a space, meet a need.
                                    
                                    You could also partner with organizations on campus. In the earliest days of the Developer Student Clubs in KWASU, we partnered with the
                                     National Universities Engineering Students Association (NUESA). 
                                    They help secure venues for the our weekly meetups.</p>
                            <h6>3. Decide the Venue and Appropriate Date</h6>
                            <img src="images/date.jpeg" alt="date">
                            <p>When you have a team for the event you have decided to organize, you should look at the University timetable for the available venues on the date you 
                                choose for the event. Also, check for the time periods when the venues would be available that day. You need to be sure a lecture, seminar, meeting, or another event is not taking place at the time you want
                                 to host your event. You could reach out to Student Affairs Unit for the University timetable.</p>
                            <h6>4. Seek Approval to Host on campus</h6>
                            <p>You’d have to write an application to host host an event via email to the office of the Student Affairs. Another option is to walk into the office of the Student Affairs Unit and hand over a hard-copy of your application. If you are not a student or staff of the KWASU, you’d have to write the application via email to the Office of University Relations.
                                Include in the mail, details of the chosen venue, date and time proposed. Also, don’t forget to describe the type and purpose of the event, the sponsors and organizers. Then await a reply.
                                
                                If you aren’t a student or staff of the University, you could reach out to the University Relations instead of the Student Affairs Unit.
                                
                                Upon approval, you may go on with putting the info out. Meanwhile, you should inform the Works and Security Department of the approved department.
                                 The Student Affairs Unit would of course guide you as appropriate.</p>
                            <h6>5. Publicity! Publicity! Publicity</h6>
                            <img src="images/publicity.gif" alt="publicity">
                            <p>After securing approval of the Student Affairs Unit, put the word out. Let the information reach your intended audience.
                                 You can go by word of mouth from department to department or college to college. You may distribute handbills and notes at strategic points on campus. You should of course intensify efforts on social media, especially Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook.
        
                                    You could involve student influencers, form PR guys to top artistes and student leaders in the respective departments.</p>
                            <h6>6. Double-check</h6>
                            <img src="images/double.gif" alt="double">
                            <p>Before the event day comes, make sure you check at the event venue with the officials in charge of the particular venue.
                                 Be sure you’re booked already and they are aware of the details of the event. You could send the Works and Security department a reminder too.</p>
                            <h6>7. Take a rest</h6>
                            <img src="images/rest.jpeg" alt="rest">
                            <p>After you have checked the boxes above, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Make sure you check with your facilitators and invited guests. 
                                Keep in touch with your team members. Rest and have a good sleep a day before the event.</p>
                            <h6>8. Have a Blast!</h6>
                            <img src="images/blast.jpeg" alt="blast">
                            <p>Make sure you show awesomeness on the D-day. Do take good care of the facilities in the venue. The smart-boards, the chairs, the fans, the air-conditioners, 
                                switches and controls and every other electronic equipment in the room/hall.
        
                                    Thanks for your attention. I hope you have a successful event.</p>

                    <p>Dear reader, when you hear a Kwasuite say, ‘anyhow anyhow’, the student simply expresses the grit and grin that goes with getting what one wants in life.
                            On the day we had our first meetup at DSC KWASU which I wrote about earlier, ‘The Eagle has landed’, we had high hopes but little knowledge of what the nearest future entails.</p>

                                    <p class="message_2">
                                            Setting up a tech community on campus later proved to be a worthwhile but difficult journey. Maybe it’s true that uneasy lies the head that will wear the crown.

                                            Before I go on, let me express my appreciation to my core team in the club whom actually made life easier for me and join hands to lift the club. Hamza (Content writer), Adedosu Tayo 
                                            (Android dev), Adedokun Stephen (Web dev), Dolapo Salako (IoT pro), Zulkifli (digital marketing), Tobi (HR), Ademola (Outreach Coordinator) and Jerry (Graphic designer). These guys literally did wonders.
                                            
                                            My story won’t be complete without appreciating our advisors, Mr. Teslim Balogun and Engr Tahir. They did not only make us accountable, they did their best to get us needed resources.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6>Training:</h6>
                                    <p>Members on our web dev cohort led by Adedokun Stephen has been had been focused on strengthening front end skills. Bootstrap and JavaScript He lives in the realm of execution not only dreams. Salako Dolapo made the IoT enthusiasts learn to code with Python through the semester.
                                         In the end, we set up an obstacle avoidance system with Arduino Uno 3.</p>
                                    <h6>Events:</h6>
                                    <p>Weekly Meetups
                                            Most of the semester was laced with weekly meetups to learn development. Initially, we had a digital marketing class of 5, later on, 3 of the members diverted to development while the remaining two 
                                            stopped attending club meetings due to demanding academic activities.</p>
                                    <h6>Figma Training</h6>
                                    <img src="images/figma.png" alt="figma">
                                    <p>Okunade Abiodun (a.k.a Fiwa) was in Malete for a week (October 15–19, 2018) as she facilitated a Figma training which we partnered with NACOSS on.
                                         The amazing Fiwa adapted quickly and easily with the living condition in Malete. More so, she was extremely good at delivering her content. She demystified UI/UX. She really worked at improving the work of our UI/UX guys. At the end of the training, she made development easier for developers,
                                         graphics easier for designers, web and mobile experience of products sweeter for tech enthusiasts.</p>
                                    <h6>Django Girls</h6>
                                    <img src="images/django.jpeg" alt="django">
                                    <p>We held a Django Girls event on campus on the 25th-26th of October, 2018 to introduce ladies to programming. The club hosted the event organized by Boluwatife Adebisi and Ajiboye Obaloluwa. 32 ladies were trained, students and non-students of the university. Each participant created a blog with the Python-Django framework. Unfortunately,
                                         we weren’t able to host the blogs online due to time constraints of the venue.</p>
                                    <h6>Blockchain Hackathon</h6>
                                    <img src="images/hack.png" alt="hack">
                                    <p>We partnered with the Nigerian Blockchain Alliance and the KwaraBuild community to organize a blockchain hackathon in KWASU on November 19th-21st, 2018.
                                         Participants were introduced to Blockchain technology and how to develop with the technology after which teams pitched ideas for the hackathon.</p>
                                    <h6>Participation in Kwara Tech community</h6>
                                    <p>KwaraBuild as an organization seeks to establish and work to strengthen a vibrant tech community in Kwara state. Starting with the KwaraBuild conference on October 1st, the community has been set up as a platform for tech lovers and professionals to meet, collaborate and help improve their environment. Fortunately, we have two of our members on the KwaraBuild’s core team, myself and our digital marketing coordinator, Ibrahim Zulkifli(a co-founder of KwaraBuild).

                                            DSC-KWASU members fully participated in KwaraBuild’s initiative through volunteering and participation in activities whilst 
                                            offering important feedback to the core team.</p>
                                    <h6>Collaborations</h6>
                                    <p>We enjoyed the good relationships which we forged with a centre and student associations on campus.

                                            Centre for African Electronic Database and Development
                                            The centre, led by Mr. Teslim Balogun had been instrumental in helping us secure a suitable venue for many of our programmes. I can’t thank Mr. Teslim Balogun (the director) less for saving myself and the club a lot of troubles. He also keeps us on our toes to ensure that we deliver according to set goals. Notably is the CITR venue is coordinated by Dr. Mope.
                                            
                                            Nigerian Universities Engineering Students Association (NUESA)
                                            Adam Musa (NUESA President) ensured that we were able to use the LR-8 of the College of Engineering building for our weekly meetups. The association also allowed us to make use of its public sound system whenever we need it for our workshops.
                                            
                                            National Association of Computer Science Students
                                            NACOSS was also a wonderful partner. Even in the absence of the President who was away for SIWES internship, the association fully supported our initiatives. From Figma training to our weekly meetings, the executives were a proactive set of guys who are about solving problems and delivering results. Even when the president, Alejolowo Samson arrived, we still enjoyed a cordial relationship with them.
                                            In conclusion
                                            
                                            The semester was tough on DSC members but we scaled through with substantial success albeit below our expectations. Majorly, electricity (absent all through the semester) and internet service (very bad) were our greatest problems. Several times I had to go to Ilorin (Kwara State’s capital city) some 32.3 kilometres away to use internet because of tweets and emails that won’t deliver.
                                             Club registration and securing suitable venues were issues of great concern too.
                                            
                                            The rigorous academic calendar won’t allow a lot of our members to practice effectively. Dealing with lectures, assignments, course projects, and research work in the absence of electricity, good internet and water was very hard and demanding, even as we have to study hard in preparation for our semester examination that always runs in 1 week.
                                            
                                            But then, we haven’t deterred in the face this challenges. We keep moving and getting better day through practice and learning. We remain committed to developing our capacity, helping our local community Malete, contributing to the development of the university community and churning out changemakers for the nation.
                                             Definitely, we are writing good history.
                                            
                                            Thanks for walking this memory lane with me. Kindly clap and recommend.</p>

                            <p class="message_3">Of course, campus events are one of the things that make university education interesting and memorable. In the last 3 years,
                             I have hosted and co-organized several events on campus. I often come across several students who are eager to host some kind of events too.
                             Where to start or how to start, seems an herculean task to them. So I decided to write few steps that will guide and help anyone pull off a successful event.Enjoy reading!
